# Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark

This is Jacky and Jeffrey version of Learning to See in the Dark. The preexisting Repository was used as a baseline. The main differences is that we implemented on our Jupyternotebooks in this Github Repository 

TraininSony_Dark_vision-Pyramid_With_automatic_Gain.ipynb <- Performs the Pyramid with Auto Luminance Gain
TraininSony_Dark_vision_Unet.ipynb <- Performs our baseline Unet Reconstruction
TraininSony_Dark_vision_MW-CNN.ipynb <- Performs our baseline Multiwavelet CNN reconstruction
