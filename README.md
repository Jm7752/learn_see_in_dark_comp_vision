# Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark

This is Jacky and Jeffrey version of Learning to See in the Dark. The preexisting Repository was used as a baseline. The main differences is that we implemented on our Jupyternotebooks in this Github Repository 

TraininSony_Dark_vision-Pyramid_With_automatic_Gain.ipynb <- Train the Pyramid with Auto Luminance Gain

TraininSony_Dark_vision_Unet.ipynb <- Train our baseline Unet Reconstruction

TraininSony_Dark_vision_MW-CNN.ipynb <- Train our baseline Multiwavelet CNN reconstruction

TrainingSony_Dark_vision-Pyramid.ipynb <- Train PRIDNet with MSE loss

TrainingSony_Dark_vision-Pyramid-SWA.ipynb <- Train PRIDNet with SWA optimizer

TrainingSony_Dark_vision-Pyramid-SSIM.ipynb <- Train PRIDNet with SSIM loss

Evaluate.ipynb <- Load a trained model and evaluate
